            Pac Auli's adventure began with two intrepid explorers hoping to
            trek and conquer all of the world's most exciting locations. They
            realized that people who enjoy trekking and bag packing need proper
            guidance during their journey of exploring various destinations, so
            they decided to form PAC AULI(Pangarchulla Adventure Camps),which
            they named after a Himalayan Peak Mt Pangarchulla.As one of the
            founders have sheer memories with this peak. We vary because we
            think in different ways. The goal of PAC AULI is not to make money
            from the travellers; rather, it is to encourage them to live in the
            moment, learn from nature, explore conventional lifestyles, and
            assist us in the conservation of natural resources, among other
            things. We help people do the right thing when they travel by
            guiding, training, and motivating them. Previously, we only worked
            in Uttarakhand's Himalayan region, but now we help people explore
            Himanchal,Ladakh, Nepal, and Bhutan.

                Anshuman’s curiosity to endeavor the Himalayas started at a very
                young age. His passion for trekking and delving into one of the
                most famous adventure sports, ‘skiing,’ started when he was 10
                years old. How did this happen? What made him so inquisitive to
                explore this mountain range? Like any other adrenaline junkie,
                he went on different treks with his cousins and their trekking
                groups from India and people from other continents. One day when
                he went for his first peak summit of Mt Pangarchulla at the age
                of 12. This was a game-changing moment for him, and then he
                never looked back. He realized that his love for the mountains
                could not be replaced; hence he started his own trekking company
                at 16. Anshuman was a different person altogether; wanted to do
                something different and break the barriers. A rank holder in
                studies from India's renowned boarding school, ’ Doon
                International School,’ he wanted to take the road less traveled
                and embark on the thrilling journey. He has brought a lot of
                accolades in skiing and competed at the highest level. He still
                participates in skiing competitions due to his immense love for
                this sport. Apart from being adventurous, Anshuman is a
                fun-loving and welcoming person as he believes in the philosophy
                of ‘Vasudhaiva Katumbakam’ that every living being is a part of
                our family.

                        Vivek Panwar discovered his passion when he was just a
                        child. Belonging to the Himalayas, he wanted to try out
                        adventure sports. At a very young age, the coaches
                        noticed his talent for skiing and snowboarding. So, he
                        started practicing this sport diligently until he
                        perfected the techniques. A naturally gifted athlete, he
                        became one of India's best skiers and snowboarders. He
                        excelled at the national level and bought laurels at the
                        international level, representing India. He has
                        officially retired from professional skiing and
                        snowboarding after years of dominance in the field.
                        Excellence at par skier and snowboarder, Panwar is
                        currently serving as a Coach of the Indian Snowboarding

                The Himalayas have an intriguing history dated back thousands of
                years ago. Each pass is unique and has some fascinating stories
                related to Indian Philosophy and Mahabharata. Our ancestors and
                descendants of Garhwali Shepherds have explored these Himalayan
                and Tibetan mountain passes.
